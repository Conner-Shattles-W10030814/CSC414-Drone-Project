To save storage and time, the Airsim wrapper and provided demo scenes atop which we developed this project are not found here.
The Unity scenes that we actually developed using them are found here as well as their metadata file.
To run them, one should download the most recent Airsim unity project from their github repo,
run the build script for the demo project, add these 2 DroneDemo scene files,
and edit the SimModeSelector's object script called "InitializeAirsim" so that
upon selecting the drone button from the game view window, the DroneDemo scene provided here is run.
